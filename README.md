1. What is HTML ?
    
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the standard language used for creating web pages. It is a markup language used to define the structure, content, and presentation of a web page. HTML tags are used to create elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

    | Elements | Tags |

    | The element is an individual component of the HTML web page or document that consists of a start tag, its attributes, an end tag, and everything in between.¬† |  HTML tag (either opening or closing) marks the start or end of an element. |
    |  They usually contain a start tag, content, and an end tag. | They begin with < symbol and end with > symbol. Whatever is written inside < and > are called tags. |

    No, all HTML tags do not have an end tag. For example, the¬†<br> tag is used to break the line, and¬†<image> tag is used to insert an image into a document. They are considered self-closing tags and do not require an end tag. HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements.

    HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are defined directly after the tag name. They only appear in opening tags and not in closing tags.HTML attributes usually contain name/value pairs like name=‚Äùvalue‚Äù
    

1. What is semantic HTML?
    
    Semantic HTML involves using specific HTML tags that accurately describe the purpose and content of elements on a web page, enhancing its structure and meaning. By utilizing semantic HTML, search engines can better understand and index the content, potentially improving the website's visibility in search results. Additionally, semantic HTML improves accessibility for users with disabilities by providing clearer navigation and comprehension of the website's content.
